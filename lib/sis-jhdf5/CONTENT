Libraries:
  lib/sis-jhdf5-<VERSION>.jar: 
    The Java class files of the JHDF5 library and the hdf5 native libraries. 
    Requires commons-io-2.6.jar, commons-lang3-3.7.jar and sis-base-18.08.0.jar on the class path. 
  lib/sis-jhdf5-h5ar-cli-<VERSION>.jar: 
    The Java class files of the h5ar archiver command line interface application.
    Requires sis-jhdf5-<VERSION> and all its dependencies, as well as  cisd-args4j-9.11.2 
    on the class path. 
  lib/sis-base-18.08.0.jar
    The Java class files of the SIS base library. Requires commons-io-2.6.jar and
    commons-lang3-3.7.jar on the class path.
  lib/cisd-args4j-9.11.2.jar
    The Java class files of the CISD args4j library.
  lib/commons-lang3-3.7.jar
    The Java class files of the Apache "Commons Lang3" library.
  lib/commons-io-2.6.jar
    The Java class files of the Apache "Commons IO" library.
  lib/native:
    The native libraries as files in folders jhdf5 and unix. In order to use them ensure that you 
    point the Java property native.libpath to the root of this hierarchy,
    e.g.: "-Dnative.libpath=/home/joe/lib/native"

Wrapper Executables:
  bin/h5ar.sh:
    A script that calls h5ar by invoking the JRE with appropriate parameters. Suitable for being 
    symlinked to e.g. /usr/local/bin
  bin/h5ar.bar:
    Example script on how to most easily invoke h5ar on Windows. Needs to be adapted to have the 
    fully qualified path to the jar file.
